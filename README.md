# Kevin's CodingBat Exercises Solutions
Repository of my own iterations/answers to the CodingBat exercises. I completed most of the Java ones when I took AP CSA at GSMST. </br>
https://codingbat.com/ </br>
Please note that these java files will not compile without a "public class" definition and a main method in a normal Java setting. </br>
The content in these java files are meant to fulfill their roles as answers in CodingBat. You can take them and put them in an IDE or use the code in your own projects. Just remember to alter the code if needed. </br>

Some of these solutions might not be the most efficient way of solving the problems, but they do act as legitimate solutions according to CodingBat.</br>

still in progress in migrating my work, should be done by tmr lol
