# Kevin's CodingBat Exercises Solutions
Repository of my own iterations/answers to the CodingBat exercises. I completed most of the Java ones when I took AP CSA.

Site where you can do these Java and Python exercises on your own: https://codingbat.com/ </br>

Some of these solutions might not be the most efficient way of solving the problems, but they do act as legitimate solutions according to CodingBat.</br>

Please contact me if there are any issues/malfunctioning code or whether you want to contribute to this repo as well.
