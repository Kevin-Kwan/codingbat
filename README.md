# Kevin's CodingBat Exercises Solutions
Repository of my own iterations/answers to the CodingBat exercises. I completed most of the Java ones when I took AP CSA at GSMST. Basically, we were assigned classwork and homework to complete these. They weren't too bad in my opinion except for a few of them. However, I do know that the formatting is horrendous (I wasn't taught about checkstyle in this introductory course in high school, and I don't currently have the time to beautify/format the files), so I apologize for this. </br>

I plan on doing the Python exercises at a later date since I'm currently still learning Python.

Site where you can do these Java and Python exercises on your own: https://codingbat.com/ </br>

Please note that these java files will not compile without a "public class" definition and a main method in a normal Java setting. </br>
The content in these java files are meant to fulfill their roles as answers in CodingBat. You can take them and put them in an IDE or use the code in your own projects. Just remember to alter the code if needed. </br>

Some of these solutions might not be the most efficient way of solving the problems, but they do act as legitimate solutions according to CodingBat.</br>

Please contact me if there are any issues/malfunctioning code or whether you want to contribute to this repo as well.
